<p>After a function has been stored in a variable,
the variable can be used as a function:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>
<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};//The function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name).Functions stored in variables do not need function names.They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement.
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x(4, 3);
    
    
    
    
    //Self-Invoking Functions
    
(function () {
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello! I called myself";
})();
    
    //The function above is actually an anonymous self-invoking function (function without name).
